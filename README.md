# C++ Linear Algebra Fundamentals Tool (My Linear Algebra Project)

This is a simple program written in **C++** that provides essential **matrix operation capabilities**.

## Project Overview and Motivation

This project serves as my **first C++ endeavor on GitHub** and has two primary goals:

1.  To **familiarize myself with basic C++ syntax** and best programming practices.
2.  To **reinforce my understanding of Linear Algebra** concepts, inspired by material like **MIT 18.06**.

I appreciate your interest and support!

## Current Features

The program currently supports the following fundamental matrix operations:

* **Matrix Transposition**
* **Matrix Multiplication**
* **Gauss Elimination**

## Future Plans (To-Do List)

I plan to expand the functionality in future releases, including:

* Calculation of the **Determinant**.
* Solving for **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**.

## Getting Started

Since this is a C++ project, you will need a C++ compiler (such as GCC or Clang) to build and run the executable.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Richard-Qin-001/My-Linear-Algebra.git](https://github.com/Richard-Qin-001/My-Linear-Algebra.git)
    cd My-Linear-Algebra
    ```

2.  **Compile the Program:**
    ```bash
    mingw32-make // on Windows
    ```

3.  **Run the Executable:**
    ```bash
    ./matrix_app
    ```
